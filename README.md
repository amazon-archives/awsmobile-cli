## Installation

The easiest way to install is using npm or yarn

**You need to have installed [Node v8.9.0](https://nodejs.org/) and above**
```

or

yarn global add awsmobile-cli
```

## Configuration

* [Sign up for the AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) to learn and prototype at little or no cost.

* [Enable AWS Mobile Hub Service Role](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home?region=us-east-1#/activaterole/) to let AWS Mobile use your AWS credentials  to create and manage your AWS services.

* Configure the CLI with your AWS credentials

```
awsmobile configure
```

Check [here](#awsmobile-configure) for more details about configuration

## Getting Started

To create a new Mobile Hub project and pull the project configuration into your app, run the following command on your terminal.

```
cd <your-app>
awsmobile init
```

Running this command enables your Mobile Hub project with two default features: (1) Analytics, for receiving the analytics sent from your app and (2) Hosting and Streaming for easily hosting your app in the cloud. The command also adds the [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify#aws-amplify) JavaScript library to your app so you can easily integrate Analytics, as well as other features provided by AWS. These features can easily be enabled using the awsmobile cli commands below.

```
awsmobile configure

#### There are two levels in the aws credential and region configurations for the awsmobile-cli
- general
- per project

When you run `awsmobile configure` outside of a valid awsmobilejs project, it sets the general configuration. The general configuration is applied when you run `awsmobile init` or `awsmobile start` command. And its values are copied as the initial per project configuration for the newly initialized project

When you run `awsmobile configure` inside a valid awsmobilejs project, it sets the configuration for this project only. It does NOT change the general configuration or the configuration of other projects.

## Usage

Go to the [AWS Mobile Docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/web-getting-started.html) to learn more about the usage of the awsmobile-cli and some sample codes to get your app up and running.
