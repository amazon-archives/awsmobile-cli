## Installation

The easiest way to install is using npm or yarn

```
npm install -g awsmobile-cli

or

yarn install -g awsmobile-cli
```

## Configuration

* [Sign up for the AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) to learn and prototype at little or no cost.

* [Activate AWS Mobile Hub](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home?region=us-east-1#/activaterole/) to let AWS Mobile use your AWS credentials  to create and manage your AWS services.

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with NPM.

* Configure the CLI with your AWS credentials. To setup permissions for the toolchain used by the CLI, run:

```
awsmobile configure
```

If prompted for credentials, follow the steps provided by the CLI. For more information, see provide IAM credentials to AWS Mobile CLI.

## Getting Started

To create a new Mobile Hub project and pull the project configuration into your app, run the following command on your terminal.

```
cd <your-app>
awsmobile init
```

Runing this command enables your Mobile Hub project with two default features: (1) Analytics, for receiving the analytics sent from your app and (2) Hosting and Streaming for easily hosting your app in the cloud. The command also adds the [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify#aws-amplify) JavaScript library to your app so you can easily integrate Analytics, as well as other features provided by AWS. These features can easily be enabled using the awsmobile cli commands below.
